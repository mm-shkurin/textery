# Story 1: Auto-generate: доклад — Progress

## Priority for Sprint 1 (decided 2026-07-07 — see .memory-bank/tasks/sprint-plan.md)

67 scenarios / 424 steps is far more than fits before Friday's deploy deadline. Work
these **P0** scenarios first, in this order — they're the walking skeleton that makes
the product actually work end-to-end and unblocks frontend integration. Branch:
`features/story-1-auto-generate-doklad`, PR into `dev` once P0 is green and deployed.

- [ ] **P0-1** — Backend 1.1: Reject request with missing topic (`red-acceptance` + `design` + `red-usecase` + `green-usecase` done, see `decisions/request-validation-architecture-decision.md`; `adapters-discovery` next)
- [ ] **P0-2** — Backend 1.2: Reject request with out-of-range volume
- [ ] **P0-3** — Backend 2.1: Valid request is accepted and queued without waiting on the LLM call
- [ ] **P0-4** — Backend 4.1: A pending generation reports its status without document content
- [ ] **P0-5** — Backend 4.2: A completed generation includes the document content
- [ ] **P0-6** — Integration 1.1: A successful provider call produces a completed document
- [ ] **P0-7** — Integration 1.2: The requested volume converts to a pinned, tested prompt budget for Cyrillic text

**Everything else below (60 scenarios) is explicitly deferred past this Friday** —
retry policy, reconciliation sweep, load, most security/infra hardening. Do not work
them before P0-1..7 are green and deployed, no matter what order `/continue` would
otherwise pick.

## Frontend Scenarios (02_UI_Tests.md)

> Re-bootstrapped 2026-07-08: this section previously reflected the pre-rewrite
> "form is the entry point" flow. `01_AutoGenerateDoklad.md` and `02_UI_Tests.md` were
> revised 2026-07-07 for the Landing → type-modal → mode-modal → generation-form → chat
> flow; this section is now remapped to match that spec 1:1 (18 scenarios across 10
> sections, up from 11). No frontend code existed yet, so nothing here was in-flight.
