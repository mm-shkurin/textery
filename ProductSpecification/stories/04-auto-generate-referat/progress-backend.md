# Story 4: Auto-generate: реферат — Backend Progress

Owns Backend, Integration, Security, Load and Infrastructure Scenarios (acceptance steps
inline per scenario). Narrative and decisions live in `progress.md`;
`ProductSpecification/stories.md` is the cross-file rollup.

Scenario 1.1 starts the story because the prompt builder is a pure domain component: it
needs no adapter, no database and no stub, so the first work unit is the smallest one
that can be red.

## Integration Scenarios (tests/06_Integration_Tests.md)

- [ ] red-integration
- [ ] green-integration

### Scenario 2.1: A provider error still ends the generation as failed
- [ ] red-integration
- [ ] green-integration

### Scenario 2.2: A provider timeout still ends the generation as failed
- [ ] red-integration
- [ ] green-integration

### Scenario 2.3: A malformed provider body still ends the generation as failed
- [ ] red-integration
- [ ] green-integration

## Security Scenarios (tests/05_Security_Tests.md)

### Scenario 1.1: A hostile topic does not take over the generation
- [ ] red-security
- [ ] green-security

### Scenario 1.2: Every user-controlled field is treated as data
- [ ] red-security
- [ ] green-security

- [ ] red-security
- [ ] green-security

- [ ] red-security
- [ ] green-security

### Scenario 3.1: A disabled card does not close the API
- [ ] red-security
- [ ] green-security

## Load Scenarios

- [S] n/a — the story exercises no operation belonging to the project's Throughput
  profile that story 1 does not already cover. Reasoning in `tests/03_Load_Tests.md`.

## Infrastructure Scenarios

- [S] n/a — no new service, container, connection, environment variable or migration;
  the moved prompt builder performs no I/O. Reasoning in
  `tests/04_Infrastructure_Tests.md`.
