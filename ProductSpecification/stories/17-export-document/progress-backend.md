# Story 17: Export document to PDF / DOCX — Backend Progress

Owns: Backend, Integration, Security, Load, and Infrastructure Scenarios (acceptance
steps stay inline per scenario — they aren't a separable layer). Narrative/decisions/Spec
checklist live in `progress.md`; `ProductSpecification/stories.md` is the cross-file rollup.

Implementation order (per 01_API_Tests.md): prerequisite/format guards → happy path →
filename & encoding → safety (SSRF, deadline, disclosure).

## Backend Scenarios (01_API_Tests.md)

### Scenario 1.1: Export of a non-existent document is refused
- [x] red-acceptance
- [x] design — new `ExportDocument(document_repository)` usecase: `execute(document_id, owner_id)`
  does owner-scoped `find_by_id_and_owner`, returns `Document | None` (no rendering this
  scenario). New route `GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/export` with typed
  `document_id: UUID` path param + `Depends(get_current_owner_id)`; `None` →
  `NotFoundException` → sanctioned 404. Absent+foreign collapse to None (owner-scoped SQL).
  Hazard scan (all 8 groups): no open GAP — grp1/2/3/8 clear; grp5 IDOR-foreign owned by
  Sc 1.2 + Security 1.1; grp5 unauth/null-owner guarded by reused story-7
  `get_current_owner_id`; grp5/6 malformed/oversize id guarded by typed UUID param; grp7
  exact-404-body already asserted in red-acceptance; grp4 title-migration owned by Infra
  3.1; grp3 read-after-write owned by Sc 3.5; render seams → rendering/4.2/4.5. No ADR
  (single viable approach, guards reuse established patterns).
- [x] red-usecase
- [x] green-usecase
- [x] adapters-discovery (rest) — Check 1 (ports): [S] `DocumentRepository.find_by_id_and_owner`
  already implemented in db adapter (document_storage.py:49, owner-scoped SQL, returns None for
  absent/foreign); exercised by GetDocument — sufficient for the not-found path. Check 2
  (exceptions): [S] `NotFoundException` already mapped to the sanctioned 404 by the document
  router's existing handler (GET /{id} raises it identically). Check 3 (response shape): rest —
  GAP: no `GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/export` route exists, so the acceptance test hits
  Starlette's default 404 body instead of the sanctioned shape. Add the route to document_router
  wiring ExportDocument (typed `document_id: UUID`, `Depends(get_current_owner_id)`, None →
  NotFoundException) → red-adapter rest / green-adapter rest.
- [x] red-adapter rest
- [x] green-adapter rest
- [x] green-acceptance

### Scenario 1.2: Export of another account's document is refused indistinguishably
- [x] red-acceptance — enabled regression guard (already GREEN): a foreign existing document
  and a non-existent id both collapse to the sanctioned 404 byte-for-byte. Asserts full-DTO
  equality of both responses against the sanctioned NOT_FOUND literal (status + parsed body +
  raw bytes + both headers).
- [S] design — no new implementation: indistinguishability is already enforced structurally by
  owner-scoped SQL (`find_by_id_and_owner` filters on owner_id).
- [S] red-usecase — owner-scoped None collapse already built + covered by Scenario 1.1.
- [S] green-usecase — same; zero production files modified for 1.2.
- [S] adapters-discovery — no adapter change; `find_by_id_and_owner` + NotFoundException already
  sufficient (see Scenario 1.1 discovery).
- [x] green-acceptance — test enabled and passing (2 passed), no production change needed.

### Scenario 1.3: An unsupported or missing format is refused
- [x] red-acceptance — RED confirmed live (got 200 placeholder vs expected 422). New contract:
  `INVALID_FORMAT → 422`, body `{error_code:INVALID_FORMAT, message:"The format must be pdf or
  docx."}`. GREEN must (1) add INVALID_FORMAT→422 to _ERROR_CODE_STATUS_MAP in
  exception_handlers.py and (2) validate `format` explicitly (raise ValidationException) — NOT a
  FastAPI enum param (that emits {"detail":[...]}). Test-review verified inline (strict assertions,
  clean placement). NOTE: /refactor + agent-review + premortem NOT run — session limit hit; a
  future session must run them over commit before proceeding.
- [x] design — new domain value object `ExportFormat` (backend/domain/src/document/export_format.py):
  members `pdf`/`docx`; classmethod `parse(value: str | None) -> ExportFormat` raising
  `ValidationException(error_code="INVALID_FORMAT", message="The format must be pdf or docx.")`
  for None/empty/unknown (case-sensitive: only lowercase `pdf`/`docx` accepted for now).
  Usecase `ExportDocument.execute` gains a `format` arg and calls `ExportFormat.parse(format)`
  **before** the owner-scoped fetch — a bad format is a 422 that depends only on the string, so
  it discloses nothing about the target document (no IDOR leak: valid-format+foreign still → 404,
  invalid-format+foreign → 422 regardless of existence). Rest route forwards `format` to the
  usecase and adds `"INVALID_FORMAT": 422` to `_ERROR_CODE_STATUS_MAP` in exception_handlers.py;
  the existing `validation_exception_handler` then emits the canonical `{error_code, message}`
  body at 422 — same reuse path as page.py INVALID_LIMIT and current_owner UNAUTHORIZED, no new
  handler. POSITIVE CONTROL (from premortem CONCERNS on f219201): red-usecase and green-acceptance
  must each assert a VALID `pdf`/`docx` export is NOT refused with 422 — otherwise a
  refuse-everything guard passes the negative tests tautologically (same gap class Sc 1.2 hardened
  against in a062c5b). Also cover `format=""` (agent-review CONCERNS) in the parse tests.
  No ADR — single viable approach, guards reuse the established ValidationException→handler pattern.
- [x] red-usecase — RED confirmed live: `TypeError: ExportDocument.execute() got an unexpected
  keyword argument 'format'` on all 6 cases (predicted == actual). 6 parametrized cases:
  negatives `xml`/`None`/`""` each assert `error_code == "INVALID_FORMAT"` + exact message
  "The format must be pdf or docx." run against an EMPTY repo (proves the guard fires before the
  fetch — bad format discloses nothing about existence); positive control `pdf`/`docx` asserts
  `found is document` (identity) — the premortem-mandated valid-format control. Sc 1.1's
  none-refusal test updated to pass `format="pdf"` to survive the signature change. test-review:
  no changes — all assertions already strict (exact-equality / identity, no loose validation).
- [x] green-usecase — GREEN at 8 passed (usecase suite 168 passed). New domain VO
  `backend/domain/src/document/export_format.py` (33 lines): `ExportFormat(Enum)` PDF/DOCX with
  `parse(value)` using exact `cls(value)` — no `.lower()`/`.strip()`, so `"PDF"`/`" pdf "` and
  non-str/None raise `ValidationException(INVALID_FORMAT, "The format must be pdf or docx.")`.
  Usecase `execute` gained `format`, calls `ExportFormat.parse` before `find_by_id_and_owner`.
  Router `/export` now forwards its existing `format` query param to `execute` (required-arg
  regression guard — no new behavior; the 422 status mapping is still the adapters-discovery /
  green-adapter rest concern). Coverage: both files 100% stmts+branch, no gaps.
- [x] adapters-discovery (rest) — Check 1 (ports): [S] `DocumentRepository.find_by_id_and_owner`
  already implemented (document_storage.py) and sufficient — the read path is unchanged from
  Sc 1.1. Check 2 (exceptions): rest — GAP: `ExportFormat.parse` raises
  `ValidationException(error_code="INVALID_FORMAT")`, but `_ERROR_CODE_STATUS_MAP` in
  exception_handlers.py has no `INVALID_FORMAT` entry, so `validation_exception_handler` defaults
  it to 400; the acceptance contract (red-acceptance f219201) demands 422. Add `"INVALID_FORMAT":
  422` alongside the existing INVALID_DOCUMENT_TYPE/INVALID_VERSION 422 entries → red-adapter rest
  / green-adapter rest. Check 3 (response shape): [S] the 422 refusal body `{error_code, message}`
  is already produced by the existing `validation_exception_handler`; the success/binary export
  body is deferred to the rendering scenarios (2.x), out of scope for 1.3's refusal path.
- [x] red-adapter rest — RED confirmed live: `assert 400 == 422` (predicted == actual). New test
  `TestInvalidFormatStatusMapping::test_should_map_invalid_format_to_422` in
  test_document_exception_handlers.py, modeled on `TestUnauthorizedStatusMapping`: a route raises
  `ValidationException(INVALID_FORMAT, "The format must be pdf or docx.")` through the real
  `validation_exception_handler`; asserts strict `status_code == 422` + full parsed body
  `{"error_code":"INVALID_FORMAT","message":"The format must be pdf or docx."}`. Currently 400
  (default) — INVALID_FORMAT absent from the map. test-review: target test already strict, no
  change. (Detector also flagged 3 pre-existing loose `not in` leak-guards elsewhere in the file —
  Security-5.1-owned, untouched by this commit, out of scope.)
- [x] green-adapter rest — GREEN: added `"INVALID_FORMAT": 422` to `_ERROR_CODE_STATUS_MAP`
  (exception_handlers.py, 78 lines); no new handler — `validation_exception_handler` already emits
  the canonical `{error_code, message}` body, only the status was defaulting to 400. Error-handling
  tests 11 passed / 0 skipped; full rest adapter suite 73 passed, no regression. Coverage:
  exception_handlers.py 100% (21 stmts, 0 branch), no gaps.
- [x] green-acceptance — GREEN live against the rebuilt backend (BACKEND_PORT=8100): 5 passed
  incl. both format-guard cases `[unsupported_format]` (xml→422) and `[missing_format]` (None→422),
  plus the three Sc 1.1/1.2 regression tests. Enabled the test by removing the RED skip decorator
  (only test change). Baked-image rebuild done per carryover quirk before running.

### Scenario 2.1: A document exports as a valid PDF
- [x] red-acceptance — RED confirmed live (BACKEND_PORT=8100): the export found-path returns the
  DocumentResponseDto JSON placeholder, so `content_type='application/json'` vs expected exact
  `'application/pdf'` (predicted == actual, AssertionError). New class `TestExportDocumentAsPdf`
  delegates to `assert_valid_pdf_attachment` (Statements): strict status 200, exact application/pdf
  content type, `%PDF-` magic-byte signature, attachment Content-Disposition, and `body is None`
  (added per test-review cluster-A: no JSON dict-body may leak on the success path). Skip-marked;
  5 passed / 1 skipped. NOTE: `document_export_statements.py` is now at exactly the 200-line cap —
  any further addition to it must split the file first.
- [x] design — PDF rendering, mirroring the established `HtmlSanitizer` port→adapter precedent
  (usecase Protocol port implemented by a themed adapter under `backend/adapters/`). Decisions
  (all substance pinned by interview 2026-07-25 — WeasyPrint for PDF, backend render, synchronous
  GET returns binary, no polling, `url_fetcher` disabled — so no open fork, no ADR):
  • New usecase port `backend/usecase/src/document/document_renderer.py` — `DocumentRenderer(Protocol)`
    with `render(content: str, export_format: ExportFormat) -> bytes` (unified over the format enum
    to avoid a per-format method explosion; 2.1 implements the pdf branch, 2.2 adds docx).
  • New adapter module `backend/adapters/rendering` with `WeasyPrintPdfRenderer` implementing the
    pdf branch. `url_fetcher` disabled from construction (SSRF-safe by default — Sc 4.1 formally
    asserts it; building it safe now avoids a knowingly-unsafe interim).
  • `ExportDocument.execute` return shape changes: after `ExportFormat.parse` + owner-scoped fetch,
    a found document is rendered; execute returns the rendered bytes + media type (absent/foreign
    still collapse to None → 404, unchanged). 2.1 uses a fixed default filename `document.pdf`
    (title-derived filename is Sc 3.1/3.2 — out of scope here).
  • Rest `/export` returns a binary `Response(content=bytes, media_type="application/pdf",
    headers={"Content-Disposition": "attachment; filename=document.pdf"})` instead of the
    DocumentResponseDto JSON placeholder. In-process synchronous render (forced by the
    no-polling binary-GET contract; render deadline/resource bounds are Sc 4.2/4.5 + Load 2.1).
  • DEPENDENCY green will require: add WeasyPrint to backend requirements + libpango/cairo system
    libs to backend.Dockerfile so the render actually executes (the baked image must be rebuilt for
    green-acceptance). The fail-fast-at-boot guard for missing native libs is owned by Infra 1.1.
- [x] red-usecase — RED confirmed live: `TypeError: ExportDocument.__init__() got an unexpected
  keyword argument 'document_renderer'` on all 7 tests (predicted == actual). Uses a
  `FakeDocumentRenderer` (in document_fakes.py) — no real WeasyPrint. Three cases: (1) happy path
  asserts `result.content == FAKE_RENDERED_PDF` + `result.media_type == "application/pdf"` (exact)
  AND `renderer.calls == [("<p>Привет</p>", ExportFormat.PDF)]` (proves the STORED content is
  rendered under the parsed format); (2) not-found returns None AND `renderer.calls == []` (a
  missing document never reaches render); (3) invalid-format (5 params) raises INVALID_FORMAT
  before fetch/render AND `renderer.calls == []`. docx positive control deferred to Sc 2.2
  red-usecase (asserting a docx media_type here would force 2.2's branch into 2.1's green).
  test-review: no changes — assertions already strict; placement flag (Statements DSL) overruled
  by the document-usecase family's inline direct-fakes convention.
- [x] green-usecase — GREEN at 7 passed (usecase suite 167 passed). New port
  `document_renderer.py` (`DocumentRenderer(Protocol)`, sync `render(content, export_format) ->
  bytes`, mirrors HtmlSanitizer); new frozen result `rendered_export.py`
  (`RenderedExport(content: bytes, media_type: str)`). `ExportDocument` gains the renderer arg;
  execute parses format → owner-scoped fetch (None → None, renderer untouched) → renders
  `document.content` and returns `RenderedExport`; media type from an `ExportFormat`-keyed dict
  (only PDF mapped now — an unmapped format KeyErrors loudly, never a wrong Content-Type; DOCX is
  a one-line add in Sc 2.2). Coverage: all three files 100% line+branch.
  FOLLOW-UP (breaks app construction until closed): `backend/application/src/app/container/
  document_wiring.py` still constructs `ExportDocument(document_repository=...)` without the now-
  required `document_renderer` — deliberately NOT wired here (the WeasyPrint adapter doesn't exist
  yet and may not import on the Windows host). adapters-discovery / green-adapter rendering must
  create the rendering adapter and inject it before the app boots / green-acceptance rebuilds.

### Scenario 2.2: A document exports as a valid DOCX
> CARRY-FORWARD (from Sc 2.1 green-usecase reviews, commit 26c1d66 — agent-review + premortem, both
> CONCERNS CREDIBLE): `ExportFormat.parse` ACCEPTS `docx` (advertised in the INVALID_FORMAT message),
> but the Sc 2.1 `_MEDIA_TYPE` dict maps only PDF and `execute` renders BEFORE the media lookup — so
> `format="docx"` on an owned document currently renders (wasted) then raises an unhandled `KeyError`
> → a 500 for a validation-passing input. No prod exposure (story not deployable until wiring lands),
> but 2.2 MUST close it: red-usecase needs a docx-on-found case, green maps `ExportFormat.DOCX` +
> renders docx, and consider moving the media-type lookup ahead of `render` (fail-fast, no wasted
> render). Do NOT let 2.2 inherit the silent 500 window.

### Scenario 2.1: Concurrent renders are bounded, not unbounded
> CARRY-FORWARD (from Sc 2.1 green-usecase reviews, commit 26c1d66 — agent-review + premortem):
> the `DocumentRenderer.render` port is SYNCHRONOUS and called directly inside the `async def
> execute`. Once the real WeasyPrint adapter lands (CPU-bound), a render pegs the event-loop thread
> and stalls co-tenant endpoints on that instance for the render's duration. This load scenario must
> assert export concurrency does not stall an unrelated endpoint, and the fix (offload the sync
> render, e.g. `asyncio.to_thread`/`run_in_executor`, plus a concurrency bound) belongs here / Sc 4.2.
