# Story 10 — Frontend Progress

Story-level narrative and decisions: `progress.md`. Backend and the rest:
`progress-backend.md`.

Scenario ids map to `tests/02_UI_Tests.md`.

**Sequencing note.** Frontend work starts after the `page_settings` contract exists in
`progress-backend.md` (scenarios 2.x and 4.x) — pagination written against hardcoded
constants would be rewritten, tests included, the moment settings land. Until then the
frontend scenarios below stay `[ ]`.

**Coverage note.** Pagination is measured by the browser. jsdom reports every element as
zero-height, so `red-frontend` can only pin the break-decision logic given *supplied*
heights and the settings value object; "does it break in the right place" has meaning only
in `red-selenium` / `green-selenium`. Scenarios whose whole claim is geometric are marked
below — their vitest step covers logic, not layout.
